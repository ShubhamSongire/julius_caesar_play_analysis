MARULLUS,", tribune"
FLAVIUS,". Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.Is this a holiday? What, know you not,Being mechanical, you ought not walkUpon a laboring day without the signOf your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?"
MARULLUS,". Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?What dost thou with thy best apparel on?You, sir, what trade are you?"
MARULLUS,. But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
MARULLUS,". What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, whattrade?"
MARULLUS,". What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucyfellow!"
FLAVIUS,". Thou art a cobbler, art thou?"
FLAVIUS,. But wherefore art not in thy shop today?Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
MARULLUS,". Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?What tributaries follow him to RomeTo grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oftHave you climb'd up to walls and battlements,To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,Your infants in your arms, and there have satThe livelong day with patient expectationTo see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.And when you saw his chariot but appear,Have you not made an universal shoutThat Tiber trembled underneath her banksTo hear the replication of your soundsMade in her concave shores?And do you now put on your best attire?And do you now cull out a holiday?And do you now strew flowers in his wayThat comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?Be gone!Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,Pray to the gods to intermit the plagueThat needs must light on this ingratitude."
FLAVIUS,". Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,Assemble all the poor men of your sort,Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tearsInto the channel, till the lowest streamDo kiss the most exalted shores of all.Exeunt all Commoners.See whether their basest metal be not moved;They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.Go you down that way towards the Capitol;This way will I. Disrobe the imagesIf you do find them deck'd with ceremonies."
MARULLUS,. May we do so?You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
FLAVIUS,". It is no matter; let no imagesBe hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll aboutAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets;So do you too, where you perceive them thick.These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wingWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,Who else would soar above the view of menAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.Exeunt."
CAESAR,. Calpurnia!
CASCA,". Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.Music ceases."
CAESAR,. Calpurnia!
CAESAR,". Stand you directly in Antonio's way,When he doth run his course. Antonio!"
ANTONY,". Caesar, my lord?"
CAESAR,". Forget not in your speed, Antonio,To touch Calpurnia, for our elders sayThe barren, touched in this holy chase,Shake off their sterile curse."
ANTONY,". I shall remember.When Caesar says ""Do this,"" it is perform'd."
CAESAR,". Set on, and leave no ceremony out.Flourish."
CAESAR,. Ha! Who calls?
CASCA,. Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!
CAESAR,". Who is it in the press that calls on me?I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,Cry ""Caesar."" Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear."
CAESAR,. What man is that?
BRUTUS,. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.
CAESAR,. Set him before me let me see his face.
CASSIUS,". Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar."
CAESAR,. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.
CAESAR,. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.
CASSIUS,. Will you go see the order of the course?
BRUTUS,. Not I.
CASSIUS,". I pray you, do."
BRUTUS,". I am not gamesome; I do lack some partOf that quick spirit that is in Antony.Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;I'll leave you."
CASSIUS,". Brutus, I do observe you now of late;I have not from your eyes that gentlenessAnd show of love as I was wont to have;You bear too stubborn and too strange a handOver your friend that loves you."
BRUTUS,". Cassius,Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,I turn the trouble of my countenanceMerely upon myself. Vexed I amOf late with passions of some difference,Conceptions only proper to myself,Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-Among which number, Cassius, be you one-Nor construe any further my neglectThan that poor Brutus with himself at warForgets the shows of love to other men."
CASSIUS,". Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,By means whereof this breast of mine hath buriedThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?"
BRUTUS,". No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itselfBut by reflection, by some other things."
CASSIUS,". 'Tis just,And it is very much lamented, Brutus,That you have no such mirrors as will turnYour hidden worthiness into your eyeThat you might see your shadow. I have heardWhere many of the best respect in Rome,Except immortal Caesar, speaking of BrutusAnd groaning underneath this age's yoke,Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes."
BRUTUS,". Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,That you would have me seek into myselfFor that which is not in me?"
CASSIUS,". Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,And since you know you cannot see yourselfSo well as by reflection, I your glassWill modestly discover to yourselfThat of yourself which you yet know not of.And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;Were I a common laugher, or did useTo stale with ordinary oaths my loveTo every new protester, if you knowThat I do fawn on men and hug them hardAnd after scandal them, or if you knowThat I profess myself in banquetingTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.Flourish and shout."
BRUTUS,. What means this shouting? I do fear the peopleChoose Caesar for their king.
CASSIUS,". Ay, do you fear it?Then must I think you would not have it so."
BRUTUS,". I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.But wherefore do you hold me here so long?What is it that you would impart to me?If it be aught toward the general good,Set honor in one eye and death i' the otherAnd I will look on both indifferently.For let the gods so speed me as I loveThe name of honor more than I fear death."
CASSIUS,". I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,As well as I do know your outward favor.Well, honor is the subject of my story.I cannot tell what you and other menThink of this life, but, for my single self,I had as lief not be as live to beIn awe of such a thing as I myself.I was born free as Caesar, so were you;We both have fed as well, and we can bothEndure the winter's cold as well as he.For once, upon a raw and gusty day,The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,Caesar said to me, ""Darest thou, Cassius, nowLeap in with me into this angry floodAnd swim to yonder point?"" Upon the word,Accoutred as I was, I plunged inAnd bade him follow. So indeed he did.The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet itWith lusty sinews, throwing it asideAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy.But ere we could arrive the point proposed,Caesar cried, ""Help me, Cassius, or I sink!I, as Aeneas our great ancestorDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulderThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of TiberDid I the tired Caesar. And this manIs now become a god, and Cassius isA wretched creature and must bend his bodyIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him.He had a fever when he was in Spain,And when the fit was on him I did markHow he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake;His coward lips did from their color fly,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the worldDid lose his luster. I did hear him groan.Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the RomansMark him and write his speeches in their books,Alas, it cried, ""Give me some drink, Titinius,""As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze meA man of such a feeble temper shouldSo get the start of the majestic worldAnd bear the palm alone. Shout.Flourish."
BRUTUS,. Another general shout!I do believe that these applauses areFor some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.
CASSIUS,". Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow worldLike a Colossus, and we petty menWalk under his huge legs and peep aboutTo find ourselves dishonorable graves.Men at some time are masters of their fates:The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,But in ourselves that we are underlings.Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that ""Caesar""?Why should that name be sounded more than yours?Write them together, yours is as fair a name;Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,""Brutus"" will start a spirit as soon as ""Caesar.""Now, in the names of all the gods at once,Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feedThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!When went there by an age since the great floodBut it was famed with more than with one man?When could they say till now that talk'd of RomeThat her wide walls encompass'd but one man?Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,When there is in it but one only man.O, you and I have heard our fathers sayThere was a Brutus once that would have brook'dThe eternal devil to keep his state in RomeAs easily as a king."
BRUTUS,". That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;What you would work me to, I have some aim.How I have thought of this and of these times,I shall recount hereafter; for this present,I would not, so with love I might entreat you,Be any further moved. What you have saidI will consider; what you have to sayI will with patience hear, and find a timeBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:Brutus had rather be a villagerThan to repute himself a son of RomeUnder these hard conditions as this timeIs like to lay upon us."
CASSIUS,. I am glad that my weak wordsHave struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.Re-enter Caesar and his Train.
BRUTUS,". The games are done, and Caesar is returning."
CASSIUS,". As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,And he will, after his sour fashion, tell youWhat hath proceeded worthy note today."
BRUTUS,". I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,And all the rest look like a chidden train:Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and CiceroLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyesAs we have seen him in the Capitol,Being cross'd in conference by some senators."
CASSIUS,. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
CAESAR,. Antonio!
ANTONY,. Caesar?
CAESAR,". Let me have men about me that are fat,Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;He thinks too much; such men are dangerous."
ANTONY,". Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;He is a noble Roman and well given."
CAESAR,". Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,Yet if my name were liable to fear,I do not know the man I should avoidSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,He is a great observer, and he looksQuite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sortAs if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spiritThat could be moved to smile at anything.Such men as he be never at heart's easeWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,And therefore are they very dangerous.I rather tell thee what is to be fear'dThan what I fear, for always I am Caesar.Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.Sennet. Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca."
CASCA,. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
BRUTUS,". Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced todayThat Caesar looks so sad."
CASCA,". Why, you were with him, were you not?"
BRUTUS,. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
CASCA,". Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offeredhim,he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then thepeople fell ashouting."
BRUTUS,. What was the second noise for?
CASCA,". Why, for that too."
CASSIUS,. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
CASCA,". Why, for that too."
BRUTUS,. Was the crown offered him thrice?
CASCA,". Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every timegentlerthan other, and at every putting by mine honest neighborsshouted."
CASSIUS,. Who offered him the crown?
CASCA,". Why, Antony."
BRUTUS,". Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca."
CASCA,". I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It wasmere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer himacrown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of thesecoronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for allthat, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then heofferedit to him again; then he put it by again. But, to mythinking, hewas very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offereditthe third time; he put it the third time by; and still as herefused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their choppedhandsand threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a dealofstinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it hadalmost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.Andfor mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening mylipsand receiving the bad air."
CASSIUS,". But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?"
CASCA,. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth andwasspeechless.
BRUTUS,. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
CASSIUS,". No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness."
CASCA,". I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesarfelldown. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss himaccording as he pleased and displeased them, as they use todothe players in the theatre, I am no true man."
BRUTUS,. What said he when he came unto himself?
CASCA,". Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the commonherd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope hisdoubletand offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of anyoccupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I wouldImight go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When hecameto himself again, he said, if he had done or said anythingamiss,he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.Three orfour wenches where I stood cried, ""Alas, good soul!"" andforgavehim with all their hearts. But there's no heed to be taken ofthem; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would havedoneno less."
BRUTUS,". And after that he came, thus sad, away?"
CASCA,. Ay.
CASSIUS,. Did Cicero say anything?
CASCA,". Ay, he spoke Greek."
CASSIUS,. To what effect?
CASCA,". Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the faceagain; but those that understood him smiled at one anotherandshook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.Icould tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, forpullingscarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare youwell.There was more foolery yet, if could remember it."
CASSIUS,". Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?"
CASCA,". No, I am promised forth."
CASSIUS,. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
CASCA,". Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinnerworththe eating."
CASSIUS,". Good, I will expect you."
CASCA,". Do so, farewell, both.Exit."
BRUTUS,. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!He was quick mettle when he went to school.
CASSIUS,". So is he now in executionOf any bold or noble enterprise,However he puts on this tardy form.This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,Which gives men stomach to digest his wordsWith better appetite."
BRUTUS,". And so it is. For this time I will leave you.Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,I will come home to you, or, if you will,Come home to me and I will wait for you."
CASSIUS,". I will do so. Till then, think of the world.Exit Brutus.Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I seeThy honorable mettle may be wroughtFrom that it is disposed; therefore it is meetThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;For who so firm that cannot be seduced?Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,He should not humor me. I will this night,In several hands, in at his windows throw,As if they came from several citizens,Writings, all tending to the great opinionThat Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurelyCaesar's ambition shall be glanced at.And after this let Caesar seat him sure;For we will shake him, or worse days endure.Exit."
CASCA,". Are not you moved, when all the sway of earthShakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,I have seen tempests when the scolding windsHave rived the knotty oaks, and I have seenThe ambitious ocean swell and rage and foamTo be exalted with the threatening clouds,But never till tonight, never till now,Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.Either there is a civil strife in heaven,Or else the world too saucy with the godsIncenses them to send destruction."
CASCA,". A common slave- you know him well by sight-Held up his left hand, which did flame and burnLike twenty torches join'd, and yet his handNot sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.Besides- I ha' not since put up my sword-Against the Capitol I met a lion,Who glaz'd upon me and went surly byWithout annoying me. And there were drawnUpon a heap a hundred ghastly womenTransformed with their fear, who swore they sawMen all in fire walk up and down the streets.And yesterday the bird of night did sitEven at noonday upon the marketplace,Howling and shrieking. When these prodigiesDo so conjointly meet, let not men say""These are their reasons; they are natural"":For I believe they are portentous thingsUnto the climate that they point upon."
CASCA,". He doth, for he did bid AntonioSend word to you he would be there tomorrow."
CASCA,". Farewell, Cicero.Exit Cicero.Enter Cassius."
CASSIUS,. Who's there?
CASCA,. A Roman.
CASSIUS,". Casca, by your voice."
CASCA,". Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!"
CASSIUS,. A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASCA,. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASSIUS,". Those that have known the earth so full of faults.For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,Submitting me unto the perilous night,And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to openThe breast of heaven, I did present myselfEven in the aim and very flash of it."
CASCA,. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?It is the part of men to fear and trembleWhen the most mighty gods by tokens sendSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.
CASSIUS,". You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of lifeThat should be in a Roman you do want,Or else you use not. You look pale and gazeAnd put on fear and cast yourself in wonderTo see the strange impatience of the heavens.But if you would consider the true causeWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,Why old men, fools, and children calculate,Why all these things change from their ordinance,Their natures, and preformed facultiesTo monstrous quality, why, you shall findThat heaven hath infused them with these spiritsTo make them instruments of fear and warningUnto some monstrous state.Now could I, Casca, name to thee a manMost like this dreadful night,That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roarsAs doth the lion in the Capitol,A man no mightier than thyself or meIn personal action, yet prodigious grownAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are."
CASCA,". 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?"
CASSIUS,". Let it be who it is, for Romans nowHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors.But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead,And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish."
CASCA,". Indeed they say the senators tomorrowMean to establish Caesar as a king,And he shall wear his crown by sea and landIn every place save here in Italy."
CASSIUS,". I know where I will wear this dagger then:Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of ironCan be retentive to the strength of spirit;But life, being weary of these worldly bars,Never lacks power to dismiss itself.If I know this, know all the world besides,That part of tyranny that I do bearI can shake off at pleasure.Thunder still."
CASCA,. So can I.So every bondman in his own hand bearsThe power to cancel his captivity.
CASSIUS,". And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?Poor man! I know he would not be a wolfBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep.He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.Those that with haste will make a mighty fireBegin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,What rubbish, and what offal, when it servesFor the base matter to illuminateSo vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief,Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak thisBefore a willing bondman; then I knowMy answer must be made. But I am arm'd,And dangers are to me indifferent."
CASCA,". You speak to Casca, and to such a manThat is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.Be factious for redress of all these griefs,And I will set this foot of mine as farAs who goes farthest."
CASSIUS,". There's a bargain made.Now know you, Casca, I have moved alreadySome certain of the noblest-minded RomansTo undergo with me an enterpriseOf honorable-dangerous consequence;And I do know by this, they stay for meIn Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,There is no stir or walking in the streets,And the complexion of the elementIn favor's like the work we have in hand,Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.Enter Cinna."
CASCA,". Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste."
CASSIUS,". 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?"
CASSIUS,". No, it is Casca, one incorporateTo our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?"
CASSIUS,. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
CASSIUS,". Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,Where Brutus may but find it; and throw thisIn at his window; set this up with waxUpon old Brutus' statue. All this done,Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?"
CASSIUS,". That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.Exit Cinna.Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere daySee Brutus at his house. Three parts of himIs ours already, and the man entireUpon the next encounter yields him ours."
CASCA,". O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,And that which would appear offense in us,His countenance, like richest alchemy,Will change to virtue and to worthiness."
CASSIUS,". Him and his worth and our great need of himYou have right well conceited. Let us go,For it is after midnight, and ere dayWe will awake him and be sure of him.Exeunt.<<"
BRUTUS,". What, Lucius, ho!I cannot, by the progress of the stars,Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!Enter Lucius."
BRUTUS,". Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.When it is lighted, come and call me here."
BRUTUS,". It must be by his death, and, for my part,I know no personal cause to spurn at him,But for the general. He would be crown'd:How that might change his nature, there's the question.It is the bright day that brings forth the adderAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him that,And then, I grant, we put a sting in himThat at his will he may do danger with.The abuse of greatness is when it disjoinsRemorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,I have not known when his affections sway'dMore than his reason. But 'tis a common proofThat lowliness is young ambition's ladder,Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;But when he once attains the upmost round,He then unto the ladder turns his back,Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degreesBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may;Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrelWill bear no color for the thing he is,Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,Would run to these and these extremities;And therefore think him as a serpent's eggWhich hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,And kill him in the shell.Re-enter Lucius."
BRUTUS,". Get you to bed again, it is not day.Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?"
BRUTUS,. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
BRUTUS,". The exhalations whizzing in the airGive so much light that I may read by them.Opens the letter and reads.""Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!""""Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!""Such instigations have been often dropp'dWhere I have took them up.""Shall Rome, etc."" Thus must I piece it out.Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?My ancestors did from the streets of RomeThe Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.""Speak, strike, redress!"" Am I entreatedTo speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,If the redress will follow, thou receivestThy full petition at the hand of Brutus!Re-enter Lucius."
BRUTUS,". 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.Exit Lucius.Since Cassius first did whet me against CaesarI have not slept.Between the acting of a dreadful thingAnd the first motion, all the interim isLike a phantasma or a hideous dream;The genius and the mortal instrumentsAre then in council, and the state of man,Like to a little kingdom, suffers thenThe nature of an insurrection.Re-enter Lucius."
BRUTUS,. Is he alone?
BRUTUS,. Do you know them?
BRUTUS,". Let 'em enter.Exit Lucius.They are the faction. O Conspiracy,Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,When evils are most free? O, then, by dayWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enoughTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;Hide it in smiles and affability;For if thou path, thy native semblance on,Not Erebus itself were dim enoughTo hide thee from prevention.Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,Metellus Cimber, and Trebonius."
CASSIUS,". I think we are too bold upon your rest.Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?"
BRUTUS,". I have been up this hour, awake all night.Know I these men that come along with you?"
CASSIUS,". Yes, every man of them, and no man hereBut honors you, and every one doth wishYou had but that opinion of yourselfWhich every noble Roman bears of you.This is Trebonius."
BRUTUS,. He is welcome hither.
CASSIUS,". This, Decius Brutus."
BRUTUS,. He is welcome too.
CASSIUS,". This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber."
BRUTUS,. They are all welcome.What watchful cares do interpose themselvesBetwixt your eyes and night?
CASSIUS,. Shall I entreat a word?They whisper.
CASCA,. No.
CASCA,". You shall confess that you are both deceived.Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,Which is a great way growing on the south,Weighing the youthful season of the year.Some two months hence up higher toward the northHe first presents his fire, and the high eastStands as the Capitol, directly here."
BRUTUS,". Give me your hands all over, one by one."
CASSIUS,. And let us swear our resolution.
BRUTUS,". No, not an oath. If not the face of men,The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-If these be motives weak, break off betimes,And every man hence to his idle bed;So let high-sighted tyranny range onTill each man drop by lottery. But if these,As I am sure they do, bear fire enoughTo kindle cowards and to steel with valorThe melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,What need we any spur but our own causeTo prick us to redress? What other bondThan secret Romans that have spoke the wordAnd will not palter? And what other oathThan honesty to honesty engagedThat this shall be or we will fall for it?Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,Old feeble carrions and such suffering soulsThat welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swearSuch creatures as men doubt; but do not stainThe even virtue of our enterprise,Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,To think that or our cause or our performanceDid need an oath; when every drop of bloodThat every Roman bears, and nobly bears,Is guilty of a several bastardyIf he do break the smallest particleOf any promise that hath pass'd from him."
CASSIUS,. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?I think he will stand very strong with us.
CASCA,. Let us not leave him out.
BRUTUS,". O, name him not; let us not break with him,For he will never follow anythingThat other men begin."
CASSIUS,. Then leave him out.
CASCA,. Indeed he is not fit.
CASSIUS,". Decius, well urged. I think it is not meetMark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of himA shrewd contriver; and you know his means,If he improve them, may well stretch so farAs to annoy us all, which to prevent,Let Antony and Caesar fall together."
BRUTUS,". Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,To cut the head off and then hack the limbsLike wrath in death and envy afterwards;For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,And in the spirit of men there is no blood.O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,Stir up their servants to an act of rageAnd after seem to chide 'em. This shall makeOur purpose necessary and not envious,Which so appearing to the common eyes,We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.And for Mark Antony, think not of him,For he can do no more than Caesar's armWhen Caesar's head is off."
CASSIUS,". Yet I fear him,For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-"
BRUTUS,". Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.If he love Caesar, all that he can doIs to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.And that were much he should, for he is givenTo sports, to wildness, and much company."
BRUTUS,". Peace, count the clock."
CASSIUS,. The clock hath stricken three.
CASSIUS,". But it is doubtful yetWhether Caesar will come forth today or no,For he is superstitious grown of late,Quite from the main opinion he held onceOf fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.It may be these apparent prodigies,The unaccustom'd terror of this night,And the persuasion of his augurersMay hold him from the Capitol today."
CASSIUS,". Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him."
BRUTUS,. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
BRUTUS,". Now, good Metellus, go along by him.He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him."
CASSIUS,". The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all rememberWhat you have said and show yourselves true Romans."
BRUTUS,". Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;Let not our looks put on our purposes,But bear it as our Roman actors do,With untired spirits and formal constancy.And so, good morrow to you every one.Exeunt all but Brutus.Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,Which busy care draws in the brains of men;Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.Enter Portia."
BRUTUS,". Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?It is not for your health thus to commitYour weak condition to the raw cold morning."
BRUTUS,". I am not well in health, and that is all."
BRUTUS,". Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed."
BRUTUS,". Kneel not, gentle Portia."
BRUTUS,". You are my true and honorable wife,As dear to me as are the ruddy dropsThat visit my sad heart."
BRUTUS,". O ye gods,Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,And by and by thy bosom shall partakeThe secrets of my heart.All my engagements I will construe to thee,All the charactery of my sad brows.Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's thatknocks?Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius."
BRUTUS,". Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?"
BRUTUS,". O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!"
BRUTUS,". Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,Had you a healthful ear to hear of it."
BRUTUS,. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
BRUTUS,". That must we also. What it is, my Caius,I shall unfold to thee, as we are goingTo whom it must be done."
BRUTUS,. Follow me then.Exeunt.
CAESAR,". Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,""Help, ho! They murther Caesar!"" Who's within?Enter a Servant."
CAESAR,". Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,And bring me their opinions of success."
CAESAR,". Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd meNe'er look'd but on my back; when they shall seeThe face of Caesar, they are vanished."
CAESAR,". What can be avoidedWhose end is purposed by the mighty gods?Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictionsAre to the world in general as to Caesar."
CAESAR,". Cowards die many times before their deaths;The valiant never taste of death but once.Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,It seems to me most strange that men should fearSeeing that death, a necessary end,Will come when it will come.Re-enter Servant.What say the augurers?"
CAESAR,". The gods do this in shame of cowardice.Caesar should be a beast without a heartIf he should stay at home today for fear.No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full wellThat Caesar is more dangerous than he.We are two lions litter'd in one day,And I the elder and more terrible.And Caesar shall go forth."
CAESAR,". Mark Antony shall say I am not well,And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.Enter Decius.Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so."
CAESAR,". And you are come in very happy timeTo bear my greeting to the senatorsAnd tell them that I will not come today.Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius."
CAESAR,". Shall Caesar send a lie?Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so farTo be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come."
CAESAR,". The cause is in my will: I will not come,That is enough to satisfy the Senate.But, for your private satisfaction,Because I love you, I will let you know.Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,Did run pure blood, and many lusty RomansCame smiling and did bathe their hands in it.And these does she apply for warnings and portentsAnd evils imminent, and on her kneeHath begg'd that I will stay at home today."
CAESAR,. And this way have you well expounded it.
CAESAR,". How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!I am ashamed I did yield to them.Give me my robe, for I will go.Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca,Trebonius, and Cinna.And look where Publius is come to fetch me."
CAESAR,". Welcome, Publius.What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,Caesar was ne'er so much your enemyAs that same ague which hath made you lean.What is't o'clock?"
BRUTUS,". Caesar, 'tis strucken eight."
CAESAR,". I thank you for your pains and courtesy.Enter Antony.See, Antony, that revels long o' nights,Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony."
ANTONY,. So to most noble Caesar.
CAESAR,". Bid them prepare within.I am to blame to be thus waited for.Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,I have an hour's talk in store for you;Remember that you call on me today;Be near me, that I may remember you."
CAESAR,". Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,And we like friends will straightway go together."
BRUTUS,". [Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!Exeunt."
CAESAR,. The ides of March are come.
CAESAR,. What touches us ourself shall be last served.
CAESAR,". What, is the fellow mad?"
CASSIUS,". What, urge you your petitions in the street?Come to the Capitol.Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest follow."
CASSIUS,". What enterprise, Popilius?"
BRUTUS,. What said Popilius Lena?
CASSIUS,. He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.I fear our purpose is discovered.
BRUTUS,". Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him."
CASSIUS,". Casca,Be sudden, for we fear prevention.Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,For I will slay myself."
BRUTUS,". Cassius, be constant.Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change."
CASSIUS,". Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,He draws Mark Antony out of the way.Exeunt Antony and Trebonius."
BRUTUS,. He is address'd; press near and second him.
CAESAR,. Are we all ready? What is now amissThat Caesar and his Senate must redress?
CAESAR,". I must prevent thee, Cimber.These couchings and these lowly courtesiesMight fire the blood of ordinary menAnd turn preordinance and first decreeInto the law of children. Be not fondTo think that Caesar bears such rebel bloodThat will be thaw'd from the true qualityWith that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.Thy brother by decree is banished.If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without causeWill he be satisfied."
BRUTUS,". I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,Desiring thee that Publius Cimber mayHave an immediate freedom of repeal."
CAESAR,". What, Brutus?"
CASSIUS,". Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fallTo beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber."
CAESAR,". I could be well moved, if I were as you;If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;But I am constant as the northern star,Of whose true-fix'd and resting qualityThere is no fellow in the firmament.The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;They are all fire and every one doth shine;But there's but one in all doth hold his place.So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;Yet in the number I do know but oneThat unassailable holds on his rank,Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,Let me a little show it, even in this;That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,And constant do remain to keep him so."
CAESAR,. Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
CAESAR,. Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
CASCA,". Speak, hands, for me!Casca first, then the other Conspiratorsand Marcus Brutus stab Caesar."
CAESAR,". Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies."
CASSIUS,". Some to the common pulpits and cry out""Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"""
BRUTUS,". People and senators, be not affrighted,Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid."
CASCA,". Go to the pulpit, Brutus."
BRUTUS,. Where's Publius?
BRUTUS,". Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,There is no harm intended to your person,Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius."
CASSIUS,". And leave us, Publius, lest that the peopleRushing on us should do your age some mischief."
BRUTUS,". Do so, and let no man abide this deedBut we the doers.Re-enter Trebonius."
CASSIUS,. Where is Antony?
BRUTUS,". Fates, we will know your pleasures.That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the timeAnd drawing days out that men stand upon."
CASSIUS,". Why, he that cuts off twenty years of lifeCuts off so many years of fearing death."
BRUTUS,". Grant that, and then is death a benefit;So are we Caesar's friends that have abridgedHis time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's bloodUp to the elbows, and besmear our swords;Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,Let's all cry, ""Peace, freedom, and liberty!"""
CASSIUS,". Stoop then, and wash. How many ages henceShall this our lofty scene be acted overIn states unborn and accents yet unknown!"
BRUTUS,". How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,That now on Pompey's basis lies alongNo worthier than the dust!"
CASSIUS,". So oft as that shall be,So often shall the knot of us be call'dThe men that gave their country liberty."
CASSIUS,". Ay, every man away.Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heelsWith the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.Enter a Servant."
BRUTUS,". Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's."
BRUTUS,". Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;I never thought him worse.Tell him, so please him come unto this place,He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,Depart untouch'd."
BRUTUS,. I know that we shall have him well to friend.
CASSIUS,". I wish we may, but yet have I a mindThat fears him much, and my misgiving stillFalls shrewdly to the purpose.Re-enter Antony."
BRUTUS,". But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony."
ANTONY,". O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.If I myself, there is no hour so fitAs Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrumentOf half that worth as those your swords, made richWith the most noble blood of all this world.I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,I shall not find myself so apt to die;No place will please me so, no means of death,As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,The choice and master spirits of this age."
BRUTUS,". O Antony, beg not your death of us!Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,As, by our hands and this our present actYou see we do, yet see you but our handsAnd this the bleeding business they have done.Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;And pity to the general wrong of Rome-As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;Our arms in strength of malice, and our heartsOf brothers' temper, do receive you inWith all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence."
CASSIUS,. Your voice shall be as strong as any man'sIn the disposing of new dignities.
BRUTUS,". Only be patient till we have appeasedThe multitude, beside themselves with fear,And then we will deliver you the causeWhy I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,Have thus proceeded."
ANTONY,". I doubt not of your wisdom.Let each man render me his bloody hand.First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?My credit now stands on such slippery ground,That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,Either a coward or a flatterer.That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!If then thy spirit look upon us now,Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy deathTo see thy Antony making his peace,Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,It would become me better than to closeIn terms of friendship with thine enemies.Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.How like a deer strucken by many princesDost thou here lie!"
CASSIUS,. Mark Antony-
ANTONY,". Pardon me, Caius Cassius.The enemies of Caesar shall say this:Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty."
CASSIUS,". I blame you not for praising Caesar so;But what compact mean you to have with us?Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,Or shall we on, and not depend on you?"
ANTONY,". Therefore I took your hands, but was indeedSway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.Friends am I with you all and love you all,Upon this hope that you shall give me reasonsWhy and wherein Caesar was dangerous."
BRUTUS,". Or else were this a savage spectacle.Our reasons are so full of good regardThat were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,You should be satisfied."
ANTONY,". That's all I seek;And am moreover suitor that I mayProduce his body to the marketplace,And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,Speak in the order of his funeral."
BRUTUS,". You shall, Mark Antony."
CASSIUS,". Brutus, a word with you.[Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do. Do not consentThat Antony speak in his funeral.Know you how much the people may be movedBy that which he will utter?"
BRUTUS,". By your pardon,I will myself into the pulpit first,And show the reason of our Caesar's death.What Antony shall speak, I will protestHe speaks by leave and by permission,And that we are contented Caesar shallHave all true rites and lawful ceremonies.It shall advantage more than do us wrong."
CASSIUS,. I know not what may fall; I like it not.
BRUTUS,". Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,And say you do't by our permission,Else shall you not have any hand at allAbout his funeral. And you shall speakIn the same pulpit whereto I am going,After my speech is ended."
ANTONY,". Be it so,I do desire no more."
BRUTUS,". Prepare the body then, and follow us.Exeunt all but Antony."
ANTONY,". O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!Thou art the ruins of the noblest manThat ever lived in the tide of times.Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!Over thy wounds now do I prophesy(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lipsTo beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;Domestic fury and fierce civil strifeShall cumber all the parts of Italy;Blood and destruction shall be so in use,And dreadful objects so familiar,That mothers shall but smile when they beholdTheir infants quarter'd with the hands of war;All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,With Ate by his side come hot from hell,Shall in these confines with a monarch's voiceCry ""Havoc!"" and let slip the dogs of war,That this foul deed shall smell above the earthWith carrion men, groaning for burial.Enter a Servant.You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?"
ANTONY,. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY,". Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,Began to water. Is thy master coming?"
ANTONY,". Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corseInto the marketplace. There shall I try,In my oration, how the people takeThe cruel issue of these bloody men,According to the which thou shalt discourseTo young Octavius of the state of things.Lend me your hand.Exeunt with Caesar's body."
BRUTUS,". Then follow me and give me audience, friends.Cassius, go you into the other streetAnd part the numbers.Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;And public reasons shall be renderedOf Caesar's death."
CITIZEN,. I will hear Brutus speak.
CITIZEN,". I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,When severally we hear them rendered.Exit Cassius, with some Citizens.Brutus goes into the pulpit."
CITIZEN,. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
BRUTUS,". Be patient till the last.Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and besilent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, andhaverespect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me inyourwisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.Ifthere be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's,tohim I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.Ifthen that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, thisismy answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I lovedRomemore. Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves,thanthat Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar lovedme, Iweep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he wasvaliant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him.Thereis tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for hisvalor,and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would beabondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is heresorude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have Ioffended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country?Ifany, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.ALL. None, Brutus, none."
BRUTUS,". Then none have I offended. I have done no more toCaesarthan you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death isenrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein hewasworthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffereddeath.Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body.Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though hehadno hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying,aplace in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? Withthis Idepart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, Ihave the same dagger for myself, when it shall please mycountryto need my death.ALL. Live, Brutus, live, live!"
CITIZEN,. Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
CITIZEN,. Give him a statue with his ancestors.
CITIZEN,. Let him be Caesar.
CITIZEN,. Caesar's better partsShall be crown'd in Brutus.
CITIZEN,. We'll bring him to his house with shouts andclamors.
BRUTUS,. My countrymen-
CITIZEN,. Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.
CITIZEN,". Peace, ho!"
BRUTUS,". Good countrymen, let me depart alone,And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speechTending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,By our permission, is allow'd to make.I do entreat you, not a man depart,Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.Exit."
CITIZEN,". Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony."
CITIZEN,". Let him go up into the public chair;We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up."
ANTONY,". For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.Goes into the pulpit."
CITIZEN,. What does he say of Brutus?
CITIZEN,". He says, for Brutus' sake,He finds himself beholding to us all."
CITIZEN,. 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
CITIZEN,. This Caesar was a tyrant.
CITIZEN,". Nay, that's certain.We are blest that Rome is rid of him."
CITIZEN,. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.
ANTONY,". You gentle Romans-ALL. Peace, ho! Let us hear him."
ANTONY,". Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them,The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with Caesar. The noble BrutusHath told you Caesar was ambitious;If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-For Brutus is an honorable man;So are they all, all honorable men-Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me;But Brutus says he was ambitious,And Brutus is an honorable man.He hath brought many captives home to Rome,Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,And Brutus is an honorable man.You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crown,Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,And sure he is an honorable man.I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know.You all did love him once, not without cause;What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,And I must pause till it come back to me."
CITIZEN,. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
CITIZEN,". If thou consider rightly of the matter,Caesar has had great wrong."
CITIZEN,". Has he, masters?I fear there will a worse come in his place."
CITIZEN,. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take thecrown;Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
CITIZEN,". If it be found so, some will dear abide it."
CITIZEN,". Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire withweeping."
CITIZEN,. There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
CITIZEN,". Now mark him, he begins again to speak."
ANTONY,". But yesterday the word of Caesar mightHave stood against the world. Now lies he there,And none so poor to do him reverence.O masters! If I were disposed to stirYour hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,Who, you all know, are honorable men.I will not do them wrong; I rather chooseTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,Than I will wrong such honorable men.But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.Let but the commons hear this testament-Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's woundsAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood,Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,And, dying, mention it within their wills,Bequeathing it as a rich legacyUnto their issue."
CITIZEN,". We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.ALL. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will."
ANTONY,". Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,It will inflame you, it will make you mad.'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,For if you should, O, what would come of it!"
CITIZEN,". Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.You shall read us the will, Caesar's will."
ANTONY,. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.I fear I wrong the honorable menWhose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
CITIZEN,. They were traitors. Honorable men!ALL. The will! The testament!
CITIZEN,". They were villains, murtherers. The will!Read the will!"
ANTONY,". You will compel me then to read the will?Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar,And let me show you him that made the will.Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?ALL. Come down."
CITIZEN,. Descend.He comes down from the pulpit.
CITIZEN,. You shall have leave.
CITIZEN,". A ring, stand round."
CITIZEN,". Stand from the hearse, stand from the body."
CITIZEN,". Room for Antony, most noble Antony."
ANTONY,". Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.ALL. Stand back; room, bear back!"
ANTONY,". If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.You all do know this mantle. I rememberThe first time ever Caesar put it on;'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,That day he overcame the Nervii.Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;See what a rent the envious Casca made;Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,As rushing out of doors, to be resolvedIf Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!This was the most unkindest cut of all;For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,Quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty heart,And, in his mantle muffling up his face,Even at the base of Pompey's statue,Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.O, now you weep, and I perceive you feelThe dint of pity. These are gracious drops.Kind souls, what weep you when you but beholdOur Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors."
CITIZEN,. O piteous spectacle!
CITIZEN,. O noble Caesar!
CITIZEN,. O woeful day!
CITIZEN,. O traitors villains!
CITIZEN,. O most bloody sight!
CITIZEN,. We will be revenged.ALL. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!Slay! Let not a traitor live!
ANTONY,". Stay, countrymen."
CITIZEN,. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.
CITIZEN,". We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll diewithhim."
ANTONY,". Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you upTo such a sudden flood of mutiny.They that have done this deed are honorable.What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.I am no orator, as Brutus is;But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,That love my friend, and that they know full wellThat gave me public leave to speak of him.For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,To stir men's blood. I only speak right on;I tell you that which you yourselves do know;Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,And Brutus Antony, there were an AntonyWould ruffle up your spirits and put a tongueIn every wound of Caesar that should moveThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.ALL. We'll mutiny."
CITIZEN,. We'll burn the house of Brutus.
CITIZEN,". Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators."
ANTONY,". Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.ALL. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!"
ANTONY,". Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.You have forgot the will I told you of.ALL. Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will."
ANTONY,". Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.To every Roman citizen he gives,To every several man, seventy-five drachmas."
CITIZEN,. Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
CITIZEN,. O royal Caesar!
ANTONY,". Hear me with patience.ALL. Peace, ho!"
ANTONY,". Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,And to your heirs forever- common pleasures,To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?"
CITIZEN,". Never, never. Come, away, away!We'll burn his body in the holy placeAnd with the brands fire the traitors' houses.Take up the body."
CITIZEN,. Go fetch fire.
CITIZEN,. Pluck down benches.
CITIZEN,". Pluck down forms, windows, anything.Exeunt Citizens with the body."
ANTONY,". Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,Take thou what course thou wilt.Enter a Servant.How now, fellow?"
ANTONY,. Where is he?
ANTONY,". And thither will I straight to visit him.He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,And in this mood will give us anything."
ANTONY,". Be like they had some notice of the people,How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.Exeunt."
CITIZEN,. What is your name?
CITIZEN,. Whither are you going?
CITIZEN,. Where do you dwell?
CITIZEN,. Are you a married man or a bachelor?
CITIZEN,. Answer every man directly.
CITIZEN,". Ay, and briefly."
CITIZEN,". Ay, and wisely."
CITIZEN,". Ay, and truly, you were best."
CITIZEN,". That's as much as to say they are fools thatmarry.You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly."
CITIZEN,. As a friend or an enemy?
CITIZEN,. That matter is answered directly.
CITIZEN,". For your dwelling, briefly."
CITIZEN,". Your name, sir, truly."
CITIZEN,". Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator."
CITIZEN,". Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for hisbadverses."
CITIZEN,". It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck buthisname out of his heart, and turn him going."
CITIZEN,". Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho,firebrands. ToBrutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, andsometo Casca's, some to Ligarius'. Away, go!Exeunt.<<"
ANTONY,". These many then shall die, their names are prick'd."
ANTONY,". He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house,Fetch the will hither, and we shall determineHow to cut off some charge in legacies."
ANTONY,". This is a slight unmeritable man,Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,The three-fold world divided, he should standOne of the three to share it?"
ANTONY,". Octavius, I have seen more days than you,And though we lay these honors on this manTo ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,To groan and sweat under the business,Either led or driven, as we point the way;And having brought our treasure where we will,Then take we down his load and turn him off,Like to the empty ass, to shake his earsAnd graze in commons."
ANTONY,". So is my horse, Octavius, and for thatI do appoint him store of provender.It is a creature that I teach to fight,To wind, to stop, to run directly on,His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;A barren-spirited fellow, one that feedsOn objects, arts, and imitations,Which, out of use and staled by other men,Begin his fashion. Do not talk of himBut as a property. And now, Octavius,Listen great things. Brutus and CassiusAre levying powers; we must straight make head;Therefore let our alliance be combined,Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;And let us presently go sit in council,How covert matters may be best disclosed,And open perils surest answered."
BRUTUS,". Stand, ho!"
BRUTUS,". What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?"
BRUTUS,". He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,In his own change, or by ill officers,Hath given me some worthy cause to wishThings done undone; but if he be at hand,I shall be satisfied."
BRUTUS,". He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,How he received you. Let me be resolved."
BRUTUS,". Thou hast describedA hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,When love begins to sicken and decayIt useth an enforced ceremony.There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;But when they should endure the bloody spur,They fall their crests and like deceitful jadesSink in the trial. Comes his army on?"
BRUTUS,". Hark, he is arrived.March gently on to meet him.Enter Cassius and his Powers."
CASSIUS,". Stand, ho!"
BRUTUS,". Stand, ho! Speak the word along."
CASSIUS,". Most noble brother, you have done me wrong."
BRUTUS,". Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?"
CASSIUS,". Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,And when you do them-"
BRUTUS,". Cassius, be content,Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.Before the eyes of both our armies here,Which should perceive nothing but love from us,Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,And I will give you audience."
CASSIUS,". Pindarus,Bid our commanders lead their charges offA little from this ground."
BRUTUS,". Lucilius, do you the like, and let no manCome to our tent till we have done our conference.Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.Exeunt."
CASSIUS,". That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:You have condemn'd and noted Lucius PellaFor taking bribes here of the Sardians,Wherein my letters, praying on his side,Because I knew the man, were slighted off."
BRUTUS,. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
CASSIUS,. In such a time as this it is not meetThat every nice offense should bear his comment.
BRUTUS,". Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourselfAre much condemn'd to have an itching palm,To sell and mart your offices for goldTo undeservers."
CASSIUS,". I an itching palm?You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last."
BRUTUS,". The name of Cassius honors this corruption,And chastisement doth therefore hide his head."
CASSIUS,. Chastisement?
BRUTUS,". Remember March, the ides of March remember.Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,And not for justice? What, shall one of us,That struck the foremost man of all this worldBut for supporting robbers, shall we nowContaminate our fingers with base bribesAnd sell the mighty space of our large honorsFor so much trash as may be grasped thus?I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,Than such a Roman."
CASSIUS,". Brutus, bait not me,I'll not endure it. You forget yourselfTo hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,Older in practice, abler than yourselfTo make conditions."
BRUTUS,". Go to, you are not, Cassius."
CASSIUS,. I am.
BRUTUS,. I say you are not.
CASSIUS,". Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther."
BRUTUS,". Away, slight man!"
CASSIUS,. Is't possible?
BRUTUS,". Hear me, for I will speak.Must I give way and room to your rash choler?Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?"
CASSIUS,". O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?"
BRUTUS,". All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.Go show your slaves how choleric you are,And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouchUnder your testy humor? By the gods,You shall digest the venom of your spleen,Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,When you are waspish."
CASSIUS,. Is it come to this?
BRUTUS,". You say you are a better soldier:Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,And it shall please me well. For mine own part,I shall be glad to learn of noble men."
CASSIUS,". You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.I said, an elder soldier, not a better.Did I say ""better""?"
BRUTUS,". If you did, I care not."
CASSIUS,". When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me."
BRUTUS,". Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him."
CASSIUS,. I durst not?
BRUTUS,. No.
CASSIUS,". What, durst not tempt him?"
BRUTUS,. For your life you durst not.
CASSIUS,. Do not presume too much upon my love;I may do that I shall be sorry for.
BRUTUS,". You have done that you should be sorry for.There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,That they pass by me as the idle windWhich I respect not. I did send to youFor certain sums of gold, which you denied me,For I can raise no money by vile means.By heaven, I had rather coin my heartAnd drop my blood for drachmas than to wringFrom the hard hands of peasants their vile trashBy any indirection. I did sendTo you for gold to pay my legions,Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?When Marcus Brutus grows so covetousTo lock such rascal counters from his friends,Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,Dash him to pieces!"
CASSIUS,. I denied you not.
BRUTUS,. You did.
CASSIUS,". I did not. He was but a foolThat brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,But Brutus makes mine greater than they are."
BRUTUS,". I do not, till you practise them on me."
CASSIUS,. You love me not.
BRUTUS,. I do not like your faults.
CASSIUS,. A friendly eye could never see such faults.
BRUTUS,". A flatterer's would not, though they do appearAs huge as high Olympus."
CASSIUS,". Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,For Cassius is aweary of the world:Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,To cast into my teeth. O, I could weepMy spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,And here my naked breast; within, a heartDearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him betterThan ever thou lovedst Cassius."
BRUTUS,". Sheathe your dagger.Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,That carries anger as the flint bears fire,Who, much enforced, shows a hasty sparkAnd straight is cold again."
CASSIUS,". Hath Cassius livedTo be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?"
BRUTUS,". When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too."
CASSIUS,. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
BRUTUS,. And my heart too.
CASSIUS,. O Brutus!
BRUTUS,. What's the matter?
CASSIUS,. Have not you love enough to bear with meWhen that rash humor which my mother gave meMakes me forgetful?
BRUTUS,". Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,When you are overearnest with your Brutus,He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so."
CASSIUS,". How now, what's the matter?"
CASSIUS,". Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!"
BRUTUS,". Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!"
CASSIUS,". Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion."
BRUTUS,". I'll know his humor when he knows his time.What should the wars do with these jigging fools?Companion, hence!"
CASSIUS,". Away, away, be gone!Exit Poet."
BRUTUS,". Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commandersPrepare to lodge their companies tonight."
CASSIUS,. And come yourselves and bring Messala with youImmediately to us.Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.
BRUTUS,". Lucius, a bowl of wine!Exit Lucius."
CASSIUS,. I did not think you could have been so angry.
BRUTUS,". O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs."
CASSIUS,". Of your philosophy you make no use,If you give place to accidental evils."
BRUTUS,. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
CASSIUS,. Ha? Portia?
BRUTUS,. She is dead.
CASSIUS,. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?O insupportable and touching loss!Upon what sickness?
BRUTUS,". Impatient of my absence,And grief that young Octavius with Mark AntonyHave made themselves so strong- for with her deathThat tidings came- with this she fell distract,And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire."
CASSIUS,. And died so?
BRUTUS,. Even so.
CASSIUS,". O ye immortal gods!Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper."
BRUTUS,". Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.Drinks."
CASSIUS,". My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.Drinks."
BRUTUS,". Come in, Titinius!Exit Lucius.Re-enter Titinius, with Messala.Welcome, good Messala.Now sit we close about this taper here,And call in question our necessities."
CASSIUS,". Portia, art thou gone?"
BRUTUS,". No more, I pray you.Messala, I have here received lettersThat young Octavius and Mark AntonyCome down upon us with a mighty power,Bending their expedition toward Philippi."
BRUTUS,. With what addition?
BRUTUS,". There in our letters do not well agree;Mine speak of seventy senators that diedBy their proscriptions, Cicero being one."
CASSIUS,. Cicero one!
BRUTUS,". No, Messala."
BRUTUS,". Nothing, Messala."
BRUTUS,. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
BRUTUS,". Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true."
BRUTUS,". Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.With meditating that she must die onceI have the patience to endure it now."
CASSIUS,". I have as much of this in art as you,But yet my nature could not bear it so."
BRUTUS,". Well, to our work alive. What do you thinkOf marching to Philippi presently?"
CASSIUS,. I do not think it good.
BRUTUS,. Your reason?
CASSIUS,". This it is:'Tis better that the enemy seek us;So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,Doing himself offense, whilst we lying stillAre full of rest, defense, and nimbleness."
BRUTUS,". Good reasons must of force give place to better.The people 'twixt Philippi and this groundDo stand but in a forced affection,For they have grudged us contribution.The enemy, marching along by them,By them shall make a fuller number up,Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;From which advantage shall we cut him offIf at Philippi we do face him there,These people at our back."
CASSIUS,". Hear me, good brother."
BRUTUS,". Under your pardon. You must note besideThat we have tried the utmost of our friends,Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:The enemy increaseth every day;We, at the height, are ready to decline.There is a tide in the affairs of menWhich taken at the flood leads on to fortune;Omitted, all the voyage of their lifeIs bound in shallows and in miseries.On such a full sea are we now afloat,And we must take the current when it serves,Or lose our ventures."
CASSIUS,". Then, with your will, go on;We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi."
BRUTUS,". The deep of night is crept upon our talk,And nature must obey necessity,Which we will niggard with a little rest.There is no more to say?"
CASSIUS,. No more. Good night.Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
BRUTUS,". Lucius!Re-enter Lucius.My gown.Exit Lucius.Farewell, good Messala;Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,Good night and good repose."
CASSIUS,". O my dear brother!This was an ill beginning of the night.Never come such division 'tween our souls!Let it not, Brutus."
BRUTUS,. Everything is well.
CASSIUS,". Good night, my lord."
BRUTUS,". Good night, good brother."
BRUTUS,". Farewell, everyone.Exeunt all but Brutus.Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?"
BRUTUS,". What, thou speak'st drowsily?Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.Call Claudio and some other of my men,I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent."
BRUTUS,". I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;It may be I shall raise you by and byOn business to my brother Cassius."
BRUTUS,". I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;I put it in the pocket of my gown.Varro and Claudio lie down."
BRUTUS,". Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,And touch thy instrument a strain or two?"
BRUTUS,". It does, my boy.I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing."
BRUTUS,. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
BRUTUS,". It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;I will not hold thee long. If I do live,I will be good to thee.Music, and a song.This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boyThat plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd downWhere I left reading? Here it is, I think.Sits down.Enter the Ghost of Caesar.How ill this taper burns! Ha, who comes here?I think it is the weakness of mine eyesThat shapes this monstrous apparition.It comes upon me. Art thou anything?Art thou some god, some angel, or some devilThat makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?Speak to me what thou art."
BRUTUS,. Why comest thou?
BRUTUS,". Well, then I shall see thee again?"
BRUTUS,". Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.Exit Ghost.Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.Boy! Lucius! Varro! Claudio! Sirs, awake!Claudio!"
BRUTUS,". He thinks he still is at his instrument.Lucius, awake!"
BRUTUS,". Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?"
BRUTUS,". Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?"
BRUTUS,". Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio![To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!"
BRUTUS,". Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?"
BRUTUS,". Ay, saw you anything?"
BRUTUS,". Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;Bid him set on his powers betimes before,And we will follow."
ANTONY,". Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I knowWherefore they do it. They could be contentTo visit other places, and come downWith fearful bravery, thinking by this faceTo fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;But 'tis not so.Enter a Messenger."
ANTONY,". Octavius, lead your battle softly on,Upon the left hand of the even field."
ANTONY,. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
BRUTUS,". They stand, and would have parley."
CASSIUS,". Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk."
ANTONY,". No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.Make forth, the generals would have some words."
BRUTUS,". Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?"
BRUTUS,". Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius."
ANTONY,". In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,Crying ""Long live! Hail, Caesar!"""
CASSIUS,". Antony,The posture of your blows are yet unknown;But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,And leave them honeyless."
ANTONY,. Not stingless too.
BRUTUS,". O, yes, and soundless too,For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,And very wisely threat before you sting."
ANTONY,". Villains! You did not so when your vile daggersHack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behindStrooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!"
CASSIUS,". Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.This tongue had not offended so today,If Cassius might have ruled."
BRUTUS,". Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,Unless thou bring'st them with thee."
BRUTUS,". O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable."
CASSIUS,". A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,Join'd with a masker and a reveler!"
ANTONY,. Old Cassius still!
CASSIUS,". Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!The storm is up, and all is on the hazard."
BRUTUS,". Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you."
CASSIUS,. Messala!
CASSIUS,". Messala,This is my birthday, as this very dayWas Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.Be thou my witness that, against my will,As Pompey was, am I compell'd to setUpon one battle all our liberties.You know that I held Epicurus strong,And his opinion. Now I change my mind,And partly credit things that do presage.Coming from Sardis, on our former ensignTwo mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,Who to Philippi here consorted us.This morning are they fled away and gone,And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kitesFly o'er our heads and downward look on us,As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seemA canopy most fatal, under whichOur army lies, ready to give up the ghost."
CASSIUS,". I but believe it partly,For I am fresh of spirit and resolvedTo meet all perils very constantly."
BRUTUS,". Even so, Lucilius."
CASSIUS,". Now, most noble Brutus,The gods today stand friendly that we may,Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,Let's reason with the worst that may befall.If we do lose this battle, then is thisThe very last time we shall speak together.What are you then determined to do?"
BRUTUS,". Even by the rule of that philosophyBy which I did blame Cato for the deathWhich he did give himself- I know not how,But I do find it cowardly and vile,For fear of what might fall, so to preventThe time of life- arming myself with patienceTo stay the providence of some high powersThat govern us below."
CASSIUS,". Then, if we lose this battle,You are contented to be led in triumphThorough the streets of Rome?"
BRUTUS,". No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;He bears too great a mind. But this same dayMust end that work the ides of March begun.And whether we shall meet again I know not.Therefore our everlasting farewell take.Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;If not, why then this parting was well made."
CASSIUS,". Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;If not, 'tis true this parting was well made."
BRUTUS,". Why then, lead on. O, that a man might knowThe end of this day's business ere it come!But it sufficeth that the day will end,And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away!Exeunt."
BRUTUS,". Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these billsUnto the legions on the other side.Loud alarum.Let them set on at once, for I perceiveBut cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,And sudden push gives them the overthrow.Ride, ride, Messala. Let them all come down.Exeunt."
CASSIUS,". O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.This ensign here of mine was turning back;I slew the coward, and did take it from him."
CASSIUS,". This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?"
CASSIUS,". Titinius, if thou lovest me,Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,Till he have brought thee up to yonder troopsAnd here again, that I may rest assuredWhether yond troops are friend or enemy."
CASSIUS,". Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,And tell me what thou notest about the field.Pindarus ascends the hill.This day I breathed first: time is come round,And where I did begin, there shall I end;My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?"
CASSIUS,. What news?
CASSIUS,". Come down; behold no more.O, coward that I am, to live so long,To see my best friend ta'en before my face!Pindarus descends.Come hither, sirrah.In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,That whatsoever I did bid thee do,Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou artrevenged,Even with the sword that kill'd thee.Dies."
BRUTUS,". Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?"
BRUTUS,. Titinius' face is upward.
BRUTUS,". O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swordsIn our own proper entrails.Low alarums."
BRUTUS,". Are yet two Romans living such as these?The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!It is impossible that ever RomeShould breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe moe tearsTo this dead man than you shall see me pay.I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;His funerals shall not be in our camp,Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come,And come, young Cato; let us to the field.Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere nightWe shall try fortune in a second fight.Exeunt."
BRUTUS,". Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!"
BRUTUS,". And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!Exit."
ANTONY,. Where is he?
ANTONY,". This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,Give him all kindness; I had rather haveSuch men my friends than enemies. Go on,And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,And bring us word unto Octavius' tentHow everything is chanced.Exeunt."
BRUTUS,". Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock."
BRUTUS,". Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.Whispers."
BRUTUS,". Peace then, no words."
BRUTUS,". Hark thee, Dardanius.Whispers."
BRUTUS,". Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word."
BRUTUS,". Why, this, Volumnius:The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to meTwo several times by night; at Sardis once,And this last night here in Philippi fields.I know my hour is come."
BRUTUS,". Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;Our enemies have beat us to the pit;Low alarums.It is more worthy to leap in ourselvesThan tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,Thou know'st that we two went to school together;Even for that our love of old, I prithee,Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it."
BRUTUS,". Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,My heart doth joy that yet in all my lifeI found no man but he was true to me.I shall have glory by this losing day,More than Octavius and Mark AntonyBy this vile conquest shall attain unto.So, fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongueHath almost ended his life's history.Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would restThat have but labor'd to attain this hour.Alarum. Cry within, ""Fly, fly, fly!"""
BRUTUS,". Hence! I will follow.Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.Thou art a fellow of a good respect;Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?"
BRUTUS,". Farewell, good Strato.Runs on his sword.Caesar, now be still;I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.Dies.Alarum. Retreat. Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala,Lucilius, and the Army."
ANTONY,". This was the noblest Roman of them all.All the conspirators, save only he,Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;He only, in a general honest thoughtAnd common good to all, made one of them.His life was gentle, and the elementsSo mix'd in him that Nature might stand upAnd say to all the world, ""This was a man!"""
