In the above dataset I have to extract only character names and their dialogues so I have applied findall and sub methods of regex equations to extract useful data from scratch and stored it in two seperate lists one for character naems an other for their spoken dialogues. 
  Using aboev two lists I have created dataframe using pandas library and stored it into csv file.
Here I have extracted dialogues of lead characters in the play and stored all this data into csv file like this
