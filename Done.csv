Upon the word,Accoutred as I was, I plunged inAnd bade him follow. So indeed he did.The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet itWith lusty sinews, throwing it asideAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy.But ere we could arrive the point proposed,Caesar cried, ""Help me, Cassius, or I sink!I, as Aeneas our great ancestorDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulderThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of TiberDid I the tired Caesar. And this manIs now become a god, and Cassius isA wretched creature and must bend his bodyIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him.He had a fever when he was in Spain,And when the fit was on him I did markHow he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake;His coward lips did from their color fly,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the worldDid lose his luster. I did hear him groan.Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the RomansMark him and write his speeches in their books,Alas, it cried, ""Give me some drink, Titinius,""As a sick girl. Ye gods!

Age, thou art shamed!Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!When went there by an age since the great floodBut it was famed with more than with one man?When could they say till now that talk'd of RomeThat her wide walls encompass'd but one man?Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,When there is in it but one only man.O, you and I have heard our fathers sayThere was a Brutus once that would have brook'dThe eternal devil to keep his state in RomeAs easily as a king.",positive,0.35305555555555557,positive

He reads much,He is a great observer, and he looksQuite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sortAs if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spiritThat could be moved to smile at anything.Such men as he be never at heart's easeWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,And therefore are they very dangerous.I rather tell thee what is to be fear'dThan what I fear, for always I am Caesar.Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.Sennet.

I saw Mark Antony offer himacrown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of thesecoronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for allthat, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then heofferedit to him again; then he put it by again. But, to mythinking, hewas very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offereditthe third time; he put it the third time by; and still as herefused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their choppedhandsand threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a dealofstinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it hadalmost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.Andfor mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening mylipsand receiving the bad air.",positive,0.01775793650793651,negative

An had been a man of anyoccupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I wouldImight go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When hecameto himself again, he said, if he had done or said anythingamiss,he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.Three orfour wenches where I stood cried, ""Alas, good soul!"" andforgavehim with all their hearts.

There is my dagger,And here my naked breast; within, a heartDearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him betterThan ever thou lovedst Cassius.",negative,-0.1,positive
